Total Arc: 3602K

Maximum words stored in Archive: 
21831*9/16/4.5 = 2728 words
    Explanation:
    21831 = the total RAM
    9     = # of string vars available (need to save one for normal operation)
    16    = all lowercase characters take up 2 bytes (16 bits)
    4.5   = average length of English words

2. Characters in string
Characters like #.!*()[]\{}~` all work perfectly in strings
However, | (vertical bar) character seems to be escaped and is always one
less than the number present. E.g. "||" will yield "|", 
"|" will yeild "" (tested on jsTIfield)
