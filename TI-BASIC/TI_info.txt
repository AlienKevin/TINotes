1. Memory
Total RAM: 21831
Total Arc: 3602K

Maximum words stored in Archive: 
21831*9/16/4.5 = 2728 words
    Explanation:
    21831 = the total RAM
    9     = # of string vars available (need to save one for normal operation)
    16    = all lowercase characters take up 2 bytes (16 bits)
    4.5   = average length of English words

2. Characters in string
Characters like #.!*()[]\{}~` all work perfectly in strings
However, | (vertical bar) character seems to be escaped and is always one
less than the number present. E.g. "||" will yield "|", 
"|" will yeild "" (tested on jsTIfield)

3. How to type things in TI-BASIC editors like jsTIfield and TokensIDE
The "Sto" arrow (→): ->
The negative sign (⁻): ~
The tilde sign (~): |~
The "squared" symbol (²): ^^2
	(Note: try ^^CHARACTER for other super-script characters, such as "sin⁻¹(")
The "pi" symbol (π): pi
	(Note: try this for other Greek characters as well, such as theta)
The actual string "pi", for example, if you're typing "typing": \pi
	(Note: this is true for all special symbols, e.g. \mu to type the literal string "mu")
The backslash character: \\
The small L for lists (ʟ): |L
Y= vars (such as Y₁): {Y1}
R►Pr(: R>Pr(
	(Note: when the token has ►, try >)
Mathematical symbols, such as √(: sqrt(
